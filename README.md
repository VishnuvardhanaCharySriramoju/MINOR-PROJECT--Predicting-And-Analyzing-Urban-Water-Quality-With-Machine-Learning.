# MINOR-PROJECT--Predicting-And-Analyzing-Urban-Water-Quality-With-Machine-Learning.
During the last years, water quality has been threatened by various pollutants. Therefore, modelling and predicting water quality have become very important in controlling water pollution. Data analysis is one of the key engines of progress in most of areas of the research in natural sciences, including environmental sciences. Continuous development and technological progress provide us with universal and advanced tools for data analysis, such as machine learning algorithms. The main objective is to explore what kind of data is provided, determine the most important factors to check whether the water is portable or not, and select the most accurate model to suitable for prediction.
